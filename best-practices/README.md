# Best Practices

- write tests: deployment should fail unless all tests pass
- start every new code repository with a README that explains the intent for that piece of software
- lint your code (e.g., tools like [this][eslint] and [this][ruby-lint])
- write [easy-to-read commit messages][good-commit-messages].
