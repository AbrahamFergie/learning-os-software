# [Learning OS Software](http://learnersguild.github.io/learning-os-software)

## Overview

Read this documentation on GitBook: [LOS Software Guide][learning-os-software-gitbook].

This is the central repository for software development at Learners Guild. It gives the back-story on the best practices and global requirements for all of our software, and also provides a "jumping off point" to other repositories that comprise our software suite. Since we manage our development flow with [ZenHub][zenhub], we can also see the [consolidated Kanban board][consolidated-kanban-board] here.

## Living Document

This is a "living" document. Reasonable efforts should be made to keep this up-to-date with the current status-quo.
