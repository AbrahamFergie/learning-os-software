# UI/UX Design Guide

This document guides the design of learner interfaces and the experiences of interacting with them.

## Top-Level Design Principles & Directives

Our interface and experience design is guided and bounded by these directives and principles:

- A web browser, or embedded browser, is the primary learner interface.
- Graphical interfaces for the web are responsive.
- When possible and appropriate, actions are provided via text-based commands.
- In textual interfaces, we use noun-verb dialogues when many operations are needed for a single object, and verb-noun dialogues when multiple objects need a similar operation performed.

Read more detailed design specifications and constraints for [Command Interfaces](command-interfaces.md) and [Graphical Interfaces](graphical-interfaces.md).
