# User Actions

This document lists and describes the actions available to users.

There are two types of users, and thus two different user experiences: [Learner UX](learner.md) and [Moderator UX](moderator.md). When working on a project, Members take on the role of either a Team Lead or Team Member.

There are some shared stories between the two (e.g. checking the status of a learner or project), so for the sake of simplicity assume that the Moderator UX is a superset of the Learner UX.
