# User Actions

This document lists and describes the actions available to users.

There are two types of users, and thus two different user experiences: [Learner UX](learner.md) and [Moderator UX](moderator.md). When working on a project, Learners take on the role of either a Team Lead or Team Member.

There are some shared stories between the two (e.g. checking the status of a learner or project), so for the sake of simplicity assume that the Moderator UX is a superset of the Learner UX.

## Common Actions

Common actions are used frequently and take the form of `> /action [options]`.

Common actions are mostly used by Learners.

For the available actions, review the [list of commands in game-cli](https://github.com/LearnersGuild/game-cli/tree/master/config/commands).

## Compound Actions

Compound actions take the form of `> /object action [options]`. The object provides the context for the action.

Compound actions are mostly used by Moderators.
