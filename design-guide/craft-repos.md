# Craft Repositories

Craft repositories are owned by the [GuildCrafts](https://github.com/GuildCrafts/) organization and are named after the craft that they focus on.

For example, the craft of "Web Development with JavaScript" is stored in the craft repo [web-development-js](https://github.com/GuildCrafts/web-development-js).

Each craft repository should follow a consistent file structure and repo metadata (issues, labels, milestones, etc.) patterns.

This document is a guide for setting up and managing craft repositories.
