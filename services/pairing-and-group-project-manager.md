# Pairing and Group Project Manager

The pairing and group project manager is responsible for keeping track of which Learners have paired with which other Learners, which Learners have worked with each other in a larger (3 or more) group, and computing ideal pairing partners based on this data, as well as (potentially -- TBD) data from the [Feedback](feedback.md) service.

During admissions, the pairing and group project manager will be responsible for computing ideal pairing partners that are most likely to agree to form a pod with each other. (potentially it will also take into account certain target pod characterstics when suggesting pairs e.g. gender balance)
