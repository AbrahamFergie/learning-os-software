# Locus

_**locus**, n.: the effective or perceived location of something abstract_

Locus is the central hub interface, primary entry point, and system dashboard which binds together other services.

## Use Cases

### System Visibility

Locus is the answer to the question "where do I go to see the whole system as available to me?". It provides a means of viewing data from and/or navigating to any service within the system.

More specifically, Locus provides an interface to everything within the **service horizon** for a given user. The _service horizon_ is the abstract space wherein all services accessible and meaningful to a particular user exist.

For example, the service horizon for a current apprentice learner might include Feedback, Challenge Taking, Pairing, and Surveys, but it wouldn't include Admissions, Alumni Portal, or IDM Admin.

### Gravitational Anchor

Keeping track of a highly decentralized system is hard enough for a designer; it can be nearly impossible for a user who has no established mental map of the full system.

Locus is "square one" on any user's journey to a service they don't otherwise have a direct link to. All key information & services are considered functionally invisible unless they are reachable from Locus in a reasonable amount of steps.

### Feedback Aggregator

Locus displays information that builds a learner's self-awareness and provides clarity around things like inbox items and next actions. Locus could aggregate and summarize data like:

- State of current project
- Inbox/queue of unprocessed tasks
- 3 upcoming next actions
- Unread feedback
- Assessment metrics visualizations

## Data Owned

Locus is an Interface Service, and thus doesn't own any data.
