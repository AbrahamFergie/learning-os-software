# Group Collaboration

The Group Collaboration service provides real-time chat and communications between Learners Guild users as well as integrations (via bots and webhooks) with other Learners Guild services.

Our initial assumption is that we will use [Slack][slack] for this service.

Where possible and where it makes sense, command-line interfaces via [slash commands](slack-slash-commands) and [bot-users](slack-bot-users) will be exposed to this service as hooks into various other services.
