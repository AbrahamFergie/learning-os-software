# Challenge Authoring

The Challenge Authoring service is responsible for laying-out the learning pathway for Learners. It will most-likely (TBD) be heavily integrated with GitHub (where the actual challenge content will live).

## Use Cases

TBD


## Data Owned

- cached copy of available challenges in GitHub (based on some conventions, e.g. -- any challenge owned by a particular organization with a certain "manifest" file at the top level)
- association of challenges, temporally, within overall curriculum
- inter-challenge dependencies (if any)
