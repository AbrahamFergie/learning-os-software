# Standard Configuration

Local development machine configuration is a matter of individual choice; as developers we are constantly optimizing our work environment.

This document serves to capture the "recommended setup" or standard configuration that we use. These are recommendations, not requirements.

## Hardware

- Mac computer
- 2.5GHz+ processor
- 4GB+ RAM

## Env Setup & Management

- [nvm][nvm] and [npm][npm] for managing Node.js versions and packages

## Runtimes (via Docker image)

- Node.js 4.* (install via nvm)
- Git 2.* (install via Homebrew)

## Applications

These are not strictly enforced -- use what makes you most productive. Still, many of us use:

- [Atom][atom] or [vim][vim] for editing code
- [iTerm][iterm] or [Terminal][terminal] for command shell
