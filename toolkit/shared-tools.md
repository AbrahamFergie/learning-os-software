# Shared Tools

The shared development tools and environments available to all software developers working in the organization.

## Source and Version Control

We use git for version control.

We use GitHub as a repository store for all services, to track issues, and to coordinate development.

## Service Generator

All services adhere to a specified file structure template.

We use custom Yeoman generators to build new services according to our specified templates.

## Default Disk Image

We maintain a Docker image with a standard environment setup. Using the [Docker Toolbox][docker-toolbox] learners and partners can run this containerized environment on their local machine.

We also use this image as the default for our remote pairing service.

## Remote Pairing

TBD.
