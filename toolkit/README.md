# Toolkit

By sharing a unified toolkit, we can collaborate more effectively.

In many cases we will leave tool choice to individual developers, but there are certain areas where we believe enforced consistency around predefined standard tools is a benefit worth the cost of reduced flexibility.

This section addresses questions like:

- Which standard tools (scripts/apps/services) do we all share and use for common tasks?
- What toolkit/environment do we provide to learners?
- How should I configure my local environment to reflect team practices?
