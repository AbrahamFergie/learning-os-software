# User

# Challenge

A piece of curriculum that may be completed by a Learner designed to teach and give practice with one or more particular skills.

# Member Learner

A Member Learner is a Learners Guild Member who is currently engaged in the program within a given Pod.

# Non-member Learner

A Non-Member Learner is someone who has not yet indicated they want to join a Pod, but may eventually convert to an Applicant. Use-case: imagine that students enrolled with Black Girls Code use the Learners Guild challenge system for part of their learning within that organization. Some may later decide to apply to become a Member of Learners Guild.

# Organization

An Applicant may belong to an Organization. Learners Guild will be one Organization. Others might be (for example) Black Girls Code.
